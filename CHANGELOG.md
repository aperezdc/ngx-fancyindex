# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]
### Fixed
- Sorting by file size now also works correctly for directories which contain
  files of sizes bigger than `INT_MAX`. (Bug report by and fix suggestion by
  Chris Young.)

## [0.4.1] - 2016-08-18
### Added
- New `fancyindex_directories_first` configuration directive (enabled by
  default), which allows setting whether directories are sorted before other
  files. (Patch by Luke Zapart <<luke@zapart.org>>.)

### Fixed
- Fix index files not working when the fancyindex module is in use (#46).


## [0.4.0] - 2016-06-08
### Added
- The module can now be built as a [dynamic
  module](https://www.nginx.com/resources/wiki/extending/converting/).
  (Patch by Róbert Nagy <<vrnagy@gmail.com>>.)
- New configuration directive `fancyindex_show_path`, which allows hiding the
  `<h1>` header which contains the current path.
  (Patch by Thomas P.  <<tpxp@live.fr>>.)

### Changed
- Directory and file links in listings now have a title="..." attribute.
  (Patch by `@janglapuk` <<trusdi.agus@gmail.com>>.)

### Fixed
- Fix for hung requests when the module is used along with `ngx_pagespeed`.
  (Patch by Otto van der Schaaf <<oschaaf@we-amp.com>>.)


## [0.3.6] - 2016-01-26
### Added
- New feature: Allow filtering out symbolic links using the
  `fancyindex_hide_symlinks` configuration directive. (Idea and prototype
  patch by Thomas Wemm.)
- New feature: Allow specifying the format of timestamps using the
  `fancyindex_time_format` configuration directive. (Idea suggested by Xiao
  Meng <<novoreorx@gmail.com>>).

### Changed
- Listings in top-level directories will not generate a "Parent Directory"
  link as first element of the listing. (Patch by Thomas P.)

### Fixed
- Fix propagation and overriding of the `fancyindex_css_href` setting inside
  nested locations.
- Minor changes in the code to allow building cleanly under Windows with
  Visual Studio 2013. (Patch by Y. Yuan <<yzwduck@gmail.com>>).


## [0.3.5] - 2015-02-19
### Added
- New feature: Allow setting the default sort criterion using the
  `fancyindex_default_sort` configuration directive. (Patch by
  Алексей Урбанский).
- New feature: Allow changing the maximum length of file names, using
  the `fancyindex_name_length` configuration directive. (Patch by
  Martin Herkt).

### Changed
- Renames `NEWS.rst` to `CHANGELOG.md`, which follows the recommendations
	from [Keep a Change Log](http://keepachangelog.com/).
- Configuring Nginx without the `http_addition_module` will generate a
  warning during configuration, as it is needed for the `fancyindex_footer`
  and `fancyindex_header` directives.


## [0.3.4] - 2014-09-03

### Added
- Viewport is now defined in the generated HTML, which works better
  for mobile devices.

### Changed
- Even-odd row styling moved to the CSS using :nth-child(). This
  makes the HTML served to clients smaller.


## [0.3.3] - 2013-10-25

### Added
- New feature: table headers in the default template are now clickable
  to set the sorting criteria and direction of the index entries.

## [0.3.2] - 2013-06-05

### Fixed
- Solved a bug that would leave certain clients stalled forever.
- Improved handling of subrequests for non-builtin headers/footers.


## [0.3.1] - 2011-04-04

### Added
- `NEWS.rst` file, to act as change log.
